**Categorisation of Urdu News Articles using Machine Learning models.**

This repository details the work done in our FYP for our Machine Learning course CS 438 at LUMS by Dr. Agha Ali Raza.

We implemented 3 ML models from scratch; Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and a simple Neural Network.

We then compared our results against the SKLearn implementations of these models, and evaluated our performance.

Also created a mock research paper, based on the ACM format.
